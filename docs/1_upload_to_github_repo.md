# üîí Uploading Code to a GitHub Repository

This guide will walk you through the process of uploading your local code to a private GitHub repository.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Git installed on your computer
- GitHub account
- SSH key set up (recommended) or Personal Access Token

## üöÄ Steps

### 1. Create a Private Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository
5. Select "Public" or "Private" based on your needs.
6. Click "Create repository"

> **Public Repository**
>
> - Visible to everyone on the internet
> - Great for open-source projects
> - Suitable for published research code
>
> **Private Repository**
>
> - Only visible to you and collaborators you invite
> - Access can be restricted to specific team members
> - Suitable for work-in-progress research

### 2. Initialize Git in Your Local Project (if not already done)

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-project-directory

# Initialize git repository
git init
```

### 3. Add Your Files to Git

```bash
# Add all files (NOT RECOMMENDED)
git add .

# Or add specific files
git add file1.py file2.py
```

> Adding specific files by yourself is the best practice which allows you to track the changes of your code. If you would like to use `.`, please add `.gitignore` file first. Check [üìù Setting Up .gitignore](#-setting-up-gitignore) for more details.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git commit -m "{commit_message}"
```

> You can add more meaningful commit messages to track the changes of your code.
> Also, check some great [emojis](https://gitmoji.dev/) to make your commit messages more expressive!
> Note that if you choose to add emoji, always use text such as `:emoji_name:` to avoid any issues.

**Advanced Tip:**

You can try [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) to add emojis from your terminal.

### 5. Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

You should authenticate your local repository to GitHub to push your code to the remote repository. See [üîê Authentication Methods](#-authentication-methods) first if you haven't done it yet.

```bash
# Replace with your repository URL
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
```

### 6. Push Your Code

```bash
# Push to main branch
git push  origin main

# Push from local branch to a different remote branch
git push origin local_branch:remote_branch
```

> For example, to push your local `feature` branch to a remote `dev` branch:
>
> ```bash
> git push -u origin feature:dev
> ```

**Tip**: You can use `-u` to push the branch and set the upstream branch at the same time. Always be aware when using `git push` since you might not know what is the upstream branch. To see the upstream branch, you can use `git branch -vv`.

## üìù Setting Up .gitignore

`.gitignore` is a configuration file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore in your project. It helps you:

- Keep your repository clean by excluding unnecessary files
- Prevent sensitive information from being committed (e.g., `.env`)
- Avoid committing large files or build artifacts

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:

```bash
# Create .gitignore file
touch .gitignore
```

> You can find more `.gitignore` templates at [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) or [GitHub's gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore). Or you can use the extension [gitignore-generator](https://github.com/piotrpalarz/vscode-gitignore-generator) to generate your own `.gitignore` file.

## üîê Authentication Methods

### Using SSH (Recommended)

1. Generate SSH key if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. Add SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Copy your public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key
   - Paste your key and save

### Using Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with 'repo' scope
3. Use the token as your password when pushing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Failed

- Check if your SSH key is properly set up
- Verify your Personal Access Token is valid
- Ensure you have the correct permissions for the repository

### Remote Already Exists

If you get an error about remote already existing:

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
```

## üí° Best Practices

1. Always use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
2. Write meaningful commit messages
3. Keep your repository private if the code is sensitive
4. Regularly push your changes to keep your remote repository updated
